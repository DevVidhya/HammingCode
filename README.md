# Data Communications and Networks Project
1. Improved efficiency in processing large data by reducing the time complexity of separating n data bits & r redundant bits from O(n*r) to O(r) <br />
2. Eliminated the effort needed in interspersing the redundancy bits at the sender & receiver end and hence made error correction highly scalable
